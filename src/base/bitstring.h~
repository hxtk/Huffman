// This class defines a bitstring. It is similar to std::vector<bool>
// and std::bitset<>. From std::vector<bool>, it takes the dynamic size.
// From std::bitset<>, it takes the semantics and implied meaning.
//
// Additional functionality includes the ability to concatenate two bitstrings
// and access to the base memory pointer.
